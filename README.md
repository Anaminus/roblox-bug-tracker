# Roblox Bug Tracker

An unofficial tracker for bugs that I encounter on [Roblox](www.roblox.com).

**[Go to the Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Anaminus/roblox-bug-tracker/issues)**

## Things

- Use the appropriate labels.
- Don't group seperate issues into one issue.
- Make .rbxl or .rbxm files and link to them (pull request???).
- You don't have to be thorough now, but be thorough later.
- If you can't reproduce a bug, don't bother.
- If you don't know what you're talking about, don't bother.

## Labels
Here be descriptions for labels in the issue tracker.
