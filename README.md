# Roblox Bug Tracker
An unofficial tracker for bugs that I encounter on [Roblox](www.roblox.com).

**[Go to the Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Anaminus/roblox-bug-tracker/issues)**

For long-winded feature requests, try checking out **[roblox-enhancement-proposals](https://github.com/RobloxLabs/roblox-enhancement-proposals)** instead.

## Things
- Try to create steps that reproduce a bug.
- Create a `.rbxl` or `.rbxm` file that shows a bug in action (no pull request!).
- Don't group seperate issues into one issue.
- Comments that do not contribute may be removed.
- If you don't understand what's going on, or you can't reproduce a bug, don't bother submitting an issue.

## Labels
Here be descriptions for labels in the issue tracker. Try to construct your issues around these labels. If you think your issue requires a new kind of label, submit an issue describing it.

### Types
