# Steps

1. Open `Bug_Sinking_Players.rbxl` in Studio.
2. Start a Server with 2 Players.
3. Once both characters have spawned, move them so that they are side by side.
4. Observe that both players are located around position `0, 0, 20000`.
5. Observe that, for either player, the other player appears to sink slightly into the ground.
